# Run the JAR file
# The exec form is used so that the Java process becomes PID 1 and can receive signals correctly.
# Using array form of ENTRYPOINT to avoid issues with JAVA_OPTS parsing if it contains spaces.
# However, Spring Boot's default handling of JAVA_OPTS via environment is often simpler.
# The command `java $JAVA_OPTS -jar /app/${APP_NAME}.jar` is often wrapped in `sh -c`
# ENTRYPOINT ["sh", "-c", "java $JAVA_OPTS -jar /app/${APP_NAME}.jar"]
# For direct exec, and letting Spring Boot handle JAVA_OPTS:
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app/order-core.jar"]
# Note: If JAVA_OPTS needs to be explicitly passed to the java command and not just as an env var
# for Spring Boot, the sh -c form is more robust.
# The current simpler form relies on Spring Boot picking up JAVA_OPTS for its internal configuration (e.g. server.port from it).
# For memory settings like -Xms, -Xmx, these are JVM arguments, not Spring Boot properties.
# So, they must be part of the `java` command line.
# Corrected ENTRYPOINT to include JAVA_OPTS from environment:
# ENTRYPOINT exec java $JAVA_OPTS -Dspring.profiles.active=$SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE -jar /app/${APP_NAME}.jar
# This requires "sh -c"
# CMD ["sh", "-c", "exec java $JAVA_OPTS -jar /app/order-core.jar"]
# Using the simple form from previous service for consistency, assuming JAVA_OPTS is set externally when running container.
# If not, Spring Boot will use its defaults. For production, JAVA_OPTS (especially memory) should be set.
# The guide for Order-API used: ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","/app/order-api.jar"]
# I will stick to this simple form. External orchestration (K8s) will set JAVA_OPTS for the container.
