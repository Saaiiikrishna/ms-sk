# Disable scheduled tasks like OutboxPoller for unit/integration tests unless specifically testing them.
# This can be done via profile activation or specific test properties.
# For example, in a test profile or by setting property in test:
# inventory.outbox.poller.enabled: false
# The @Scheduled annotation can be conditionally enabled/disabled using Spring profiles on the component or config.

# Example: Disable Keycloak for tests if not testing security aspects explicitly
# keycloak:
#   enabled: false
